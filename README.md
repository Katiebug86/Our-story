Getting to know the shop


As a single parent who cannot find work due to limitations and disability income nothing able to find a job or keep a job long at all was extremely difficult so I knew I needed to try to find some kind of work or another source of income that I would be able to do from home.
I realized I had some interests in making handmade organic products and that's when I began with making candles first. I had so much fun and enjoyed making candles that I decided to add a new product. That's when the next project began. So far, since November 1summer.
 I've made dozens of candles and soaps.
The next project of items I am adding in will be lip balm, bath bombs, lip glass, lipstick, shampoos and conditioners, jewelry, resin, and much more. 
The most difficult part is the financial situation because I haven't exactly gained any clientele other than family. With it being winter time, there's no farmers markets around. So the idea is to make as much as I can and be prepared for the sunmer. Wish me luck!
